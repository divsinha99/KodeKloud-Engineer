# Task:

The Nautilus development team has initiated a new project development, establishing various Git repositories to manage each project's source code. Recently, a repository named /opt/official.git was created. The team has provided a sample index.html file located on the jump host under the /tmp directory. This repository has been cloned to /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on the storage server in the Stratos DC.

1. Copy the sample index.html file from the jump host to the storage server placing it within the cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official.

2. Add and commit the file to the repository.

3. Push the changes to the master branch.

# Solution:

```sh
# Go to the tmp directory of jump host server
cd /tmp

# Check the index.html file
ls

# run sudo scp command to copy this file to the storage server's tmp directory
sudo scp index.html natasha@172.16.238.15:/tmp

# ssh into the storage server
ssh natasha@172.16.238.15
# --> Enter the credentials of server

# Go to the tmp folder to see if index.html file is present
cd /tmp
ls

# Copy the file from tmp folder to /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official
sudo cp index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official

# Check Git status
git status

# push changes to git
sudo git add .
sudo git commit -m "Added index.html"
sudo git push origin master
```
