# 	Task

Create one subnet named xfusion-subnet under default VPC.



#   Solution

Find out the vpc id and cidr range of the default VPC and then check what all subnet ids are existing so as not to conflict with the existing subnets.

```sh
aws ec2 describe-vpcs  --> To find out the vpc id and cidr block of the vpc id
aws ec2 describe-subnets --> To find out list of all subnets in that vpc

# New subnet to be created which should not conflict with the existing subnet ids:
aws ec2 create-subnet \
--tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=xfusion-subnet}]' \
--vpc-id vpc-046bb09d91949f938 \
--cidr-block 172.31.128.0/17
```
